		<h1>Every problem has a solution. My daily challenge in work and life is simply to find the best one.</h1>

<h2>My Approach</h2>

<p>I don't have the answers to all of life's problems but I sure know how to find them. Whether it's Internet searching to troubleshoot an error, testing digital files or user workflows, or completing a week's worth of tasks in a few days to accommodate a last-minute request, I'm presented daily by all sorts of problems and I love the challenge of finding the best solution. By staying organized, working efficiently and keeping a sense of humor I tackle the toughest problem head on to meet my deadlines and please my clients.</p>

<h2>My Background</h2>

<p>I've been solving graphic design problems for 10+ years by honing my craft and developing fast work habits. I'm also an excellent listener and know when to give the people what they want. With my art and photography projects I found solutions through observation and practice. I pay attention. Recent interests in user experience and web development directed me to complete coursework through Thinkful.com in which I solved real-world problems by trial and error and collaboration with an industry expert mentor. I have built onto my strong visual design foundation by learning usability and coding. My high level of motivation and ability to work independently (and remotely via video chats and community boards) contributes to my fantastic work ethic.</p>

<h2>My Process</h2>

<p>When I'm creating art, design or an experience my focus is always on the process. I'm a believer in following the tried and true steps but I'm not afraid to throw it all out of the window and take a different direction when necessary. I think quickly on my feet and am able to make decisive decisions then back them up.</p>

<h2>My Journey</h2>

<p>I live in Charlotte, NC but am originally from Pennsylvania and have lived up and down the East Coast. This comes in handy sometimes as I communicate daily with people across the country and can often make a unique connection with them to a place I've lived. It really is a small world. Life's challenges these days sometimes consist of middle school drama as I'm busy raising two energetic daughters (with tremendous help from my husband) who help me stay present, keep my life full and pay me generously with hugs.</p>
